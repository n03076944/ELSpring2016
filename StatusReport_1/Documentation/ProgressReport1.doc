Progress Report


The project Jonathan Greenberg and I were assigned is to create a web interface that allows the user to control a Raspeberry Pi Camera attachment. The interface allows the user to rotate the camera and take pictures with it. The web interface then displays the image that was taken. We have spent the last couple weeks getting used to the hardware, and how to use web interfaces We have managed to figure out how to take pictures with the module. We used Raspistill software to complete this process. Raspistill also provides us with many customizable settings for the camera. A couple of examples is the brightness of the picture or the sharpness of it. The web interface proved to be a trickier task to figure out. We decided to use the software Flask and html to display the images that were taken from the camera module.
	
	Jonathan and I are both computer science majors so getting the web interface completed has proved to be a much easier task then the hardware side of the project. We are currently working on the logistics of how the camera will physically move. The plan is to use a Pi Servo Hat. The ultimate goal would be to edit the web interface so it can control the Pi Servo Hat and change the angle of the camera. We are currently exploring options to simplify this process. We may use 90 degree intervals. This allows the camera to shift to 0 degrees, 90 degrees, 180 degrees, 270 degrees, and back to 0/360 degrees. Jonathan is proving to be more comfortable working on the interface while I have taken on the role of getting the camera module to work. Both of us will have to do some self teaching in order to get the module to be able to adjust it’s angle based off of the web interface’s instruction. After a couple weeks we have both become more comfortable with the software and hardware we will be utilizing. With about a month left to go, we have put ourselves in a good position to get the camera movement enabled and completely finish the accompanying web interface.
